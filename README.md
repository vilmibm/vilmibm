# 30, 60, 90

When you first start out at GitHub we do goals for 30, 60, 90 to make sure you are on track. This mostly revolves around getting you involved in projects that will allow you to go through the normal workflow of working at GitHub so you are comfortable with your work environment and working with your team.

In addition to this you'll collaborate with your manager to add specific, actionable contributions to the projects that you and your team will be working on over the next 3 months.
