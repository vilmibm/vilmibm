### About me

I grew up in the woods in a semi-rural town called Pleasant Valley in New York. I moved to Richmond, IN for college and have since lived in Atlanta, GA, Portland, OR, and now Long Beach, CA.

I live with my partner (also a [hubber](https://github.com/spinecone)!) and my [cat](https://tilde.town/~vilmibm/cat.html).

It's been a weird trip from being a kid wandering in the forest poking at dead stuff and falling into swamps to being a career software engineer. Computers have always been magical, exciting things for me but I wanted to be a writer (or a librarian). When in my first year of college it really hit me how much money I'd just signed up to spend, so I figured I should try and get a job that provided financial security. I've been a paid programmer since then (my first programmer job was writing Perl for my college as a workstudy programmer).

My parents still live in the same house in Pleasant Valley. I will never stop looking up to my amazing older sister who is a [minor celebrity](https://circulatingideas.com/2018/04/24/131-rebekkah-smith-aldrich/) in the world of libraries nor my older brother whose lifelong commitment to dadaist art provides the foundation to my own creative work.

I've dealt with an anxiety disorder my whole life and am always down to talk to people about it or living with mental health stuff (either first or second hand).


### Interests

* **Community and identity online**. I maintain a [social unix server](https://tilde.town) with a goal of radical inclusivity, peer education, digital expression and safe community. I love to read books bout how people form identities and relationships in digital spaces and try to apply what I learn when adminstering Tilde Town.
* **VHS tapes**. I scour thrift stores and yard sales for forgotten tapes; the more bootleg and/or home-made the better.
* **Games**. I love my PS4.
* **Cyberpunk media**. I love 90s era cyberpunk / cyberpunk-adjacent stuff. I have a (super bragging rn) large collection of trade paperbacks i've dug up in musty bookstores all around the country for books no one really wanted to remember because of cheesy depictions of cyberspace. Sometimes they're good! I started an [encyclopedia project](https://neongrid.space) but it's been on hiatus.
* **Programming**. I spend a lot of my free time writing personal projects in Python.
* **Sichuan cuisine**. Tell me about your favorite places to get [Mapo Tofu](https://tilde.town/~vilmibm/thoughts/mapo.html). I will go to them.

### Values

* Empathy, especially its promotion online. Technology is mostly used to magnify ignorance and hate (because it's profitable), but it can be just as effective at magnifying empathy. I believe in carefully designing and thinking about the tools we make to maximize healthy human connection.
* Diversity. Monocultures inbreed ideas, creating fearful and defensive communities.
* Trust and verification in equal measure. I try to listen to and take seriously *everything* around me, opposing or dismissing it only once I've thought (or felt) it through.
* Feels. We can't escape them, so let's figure out how to talk about them and process them heathfully.
